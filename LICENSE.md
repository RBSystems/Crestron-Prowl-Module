The Prowl Notifications module provides the ability for a Crestron program to send push notifications to your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad.   With this module you can, for example:

1.	Send a notification to your phone when the burglar alarm is tripped.  The iOS Prowl App can then automatically open the Live Cams Pro app on your phone to view cameras around your house.  

2.	Send a notification to your phone when the temperature in your house gets too cold and there is risk of a pipe freezing.  This could trigger the prowl app to automatically open the Crestron app on your iPhone so you can turn on the heat.   

The module is written in Simpl# and this download includes an example program demonstrating its use as well as detailed help files.

This module is released as shareware.  As a developer the module is free for use on your own personal Crestron system.  However, if you decide to use it on customer systems where you, or the dealer/csp you work for will profit from it than I ask for a single payment of $100.  

What you get is 

1) My thanks
2) Permission to use the module on as many client projects as you want
3) A copy of the Simpl# source code for the module (only a binary executable is included with the example program)
4) Good Karma

You can contact me at jay.m.basen@gmail.com to arrange for payment.

Thanks
